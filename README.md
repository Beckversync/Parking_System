## 🌐 System Overview

### ⚙️ ESP32 Integration
The ESP32 microcontroller acts as the edge device, handling:
- 🛠️ Sensor Input: RFID, infrared sensors, and camera modules.
- 📸 License Plate Detection: Captures vehicle images using camera and sends them to a backend or image processor.
- ☁️ Firebase Communication: Updates vehicle status to Firebase Realtime Database in real-time.

### 💻 Web Application
Built using **C#**, the WebApp allows:
- 📊 Real-time monitoring of parking slots
- 🛑 Control of servo-based barrier gates
- 🔍 Display of recognized license plates and timestamps

### 🔥 Firebase
Used for cloud storage and live synchronization:
- 🚗 Logs entry/exit data
- 🅿️ Manages slot availability and barrier control status

## 🧠 License Plate Recognition with SVM

A machine learning algorithm was developed using MATLAB to process vehicle license plate images based on the following pipeline:

### 🧪 7-Step Processing Algorithm:
1. **Input Image**: `.jpg` images of license plates.
2. **Pre-processing**: Grayscale conversion, binarization, noise reduction.
3. **License Plate Localization**: Detecting character regions.
4. **Character Segmentation**: Isolating individual characters.
5. **Character Enhancement**: Binarization and cropping of characters.
6. **Character Recognition using SVM**:
   - Linear kernel SVM
   - Trained on 36 classes (A-Z, 0-9)
7. **Store Output**: Recognized plate numbers saved in a `log.txt` file.

📊 **Performance** (on 26 test images):
- License Plate Detection: 88%
- Character Segmentation: 84%
- Recognition Accuracy: 77%
